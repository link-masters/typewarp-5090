# Zero Width Character Generator

The **Zero Width Character Generator** creates invisible Unicode characters that occupy zero visual space but are treated as real text by apps and platforms. These characters — including Zero-Width Space (ZWSP), Zero-Width Joiner (ZWJ), and Zero-Width Non-Joiner (ZWNJ) — are essential for creating blank names, hidden text watermarks, and bypassing "empty field" restrictions on social media.

This tool works alongside our [Invisible Character Generator](/text-tools/invisible-character), focusing specifically on zero-width Unicode code points rather than visual filler characters.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ>
<FAQItem q="What's the difference between this and the Invisible Character tool?">

The [Invisible Character Generator](/text-tools/invisible-character) uses characters like Hangul Filler and Braille Blank that take up visual space but appear empty. This **Zero Width** tool uses characters that have literally zero width — they're completely invisible even to the character counter on most platforms.

</FAQItem>
<FAQItem q="Can platforms detect zero-width characters?">

Some platforms actively filter zero-width characters in usernames. However, they still work in messages, bios, and posts on most social media platforms as of 2026.

</FAQItem>
<FAQItem q="Are zero-width characters safe to use?">

Yes. They are part of the official Unicode standard and are widely used in legitimate applications like text rendering, emoji sequences, and multilingual typography.
