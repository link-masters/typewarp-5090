# Title Case Converter

Transform messy text into perfectly formatted **Title Case** with a single click. Our **Title Case Converter** capitalizes the first letter of every word, giving your headlines, blog titles, and subject lines a professional, polished look.

## How It Works

Paste your text, and the tool automatically capitalizes the first letter of each significant word. The result is clean, readable, and publication-ready:

- `how to write better headlines` → `How To Write Better Headlines`
- `the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog` → `The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog`

Use the settings panel to switch between Title Case, Sentence Case, Alternating Case, and more.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ>
<FAQItem q="What's the difference between Title Case and Sentence Case?">

**Title Case** capitalizes the first letter of every word (e.g., "The Art Of Writing"). **Sentence Case** only capitalizes the first letter of each sentence (e.g., "The art of writing"). Use our [Sentence Case Converter](/text-tools/sentence-case) for the latter.

</FAQItem>
<FAQItem q="Does this handle small words like 'of', 'the', 'and'?">

Our tool capitalizes every word by default for maximum flexibility. You can manually adjust small prepositions if your style guide requires it.

</FAQItem>
<FAQItem q="Is Title Case better for SEO?">

Yes! Properly capitalized titles are easier to read and tend to get higher click-through rates in search results, which indirectly boosts your SEO performance.
