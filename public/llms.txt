# TypeWarp

> TypeWarp is a free, privacy-first text transformation platform that converts standard text into stylized Unicode typography. All processing runs entirely in the browser — no data is ever sent to servers.

## About

TypeWarp provides 90+ text transformation tools organized into 7 categories. Users type or paste text and get real-time stylized output they can copy and use on Instagram, Discord, TikTok, Twitter, Facebook, and other platforms. The output is standard Unicode text, not images or custom fonts, so it works everywhere.
